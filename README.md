## About the Data

The analysis examines COVID-19 Hospitalizations as reported weekly from all 50 states including the District of Columbia, from July 31, 2020 until March 18, 2021.

Data was acquired through the [United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)](https://healthdata.gov/Hospital/COVID-19-Reported-Patient-Impact-and-Hospital-Capa/g62h-syeh)[1,2]

[Helpful FAQ Resource](https://github.com/CareSet/COVID_Hospital_PUF?src=hd)[3]

Hospitalization rates were standardized per 100,000 adults or children using the U.S Census Bureau's 2020 National and Regional population estimates[4]

## **To Run Notebook**

**1. Clone this repo:**

```git clone https://github.com/meghutch/COVID-19-Hospitalization-Trends.git```

**2. Run Hospitalizations_Trends.Rmd**

**3. (Optional): Download latest data from the [(HHS)](https://healthdata.gov/Hospital/COVID-19-Reported-Patient-Impact-and-Hospital-Capa/g62h-syeh) and replace the new file name:**

**Alternatively, one may choose to run Hospitalizations_Trends_Hospital_Level.Rmd to conduct a similar analysis on HHS [Hospital level data](https://healthdata.gov/Hospital/COVID-19-Reported-Patient-Impact-and-Hospital-Capa/g62h-syeh)[5]**

```hhs_data <- read_csv('data/new_file_name_here.csv)```

## **Analysis**

The Analysis reports the median standardized hospitalization rates and plots figures of the trends. The change point analysis finds identifies the most likely time point for the shift in mean hospitalizations [6] (**R/change_point_function.R** written by [Molei Liu](https://github.com/moleibobliu))
